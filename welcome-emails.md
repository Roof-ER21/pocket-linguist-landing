**Subject line:** Your Language Cheat Sheet is here 🌐

**Preview text:** 50 phrases, 10 languages, ready to use today

---

**Body:**

Hey {{first_name}},

You just made a great decision.

Your **Language Cheat Sheet** is attached to this email as a PDF. Save it to your phone, screenshot the languages you need, or print it out and put it on your wall.

**Here's what's inside:**

- 50 essential phrases per language (greetings, directions, ordering food, emergencies, small talk)
- Phonetic pronunciation for every single phrase — no linguistics background needed
- All 10 languages: Spanish, French, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, German, Italian, Portuguese, Arabic & Hindi

**How to use it:**

1. Pick the 1–2 languages you care about most
2. Screenshot those pages onto your phone camera roll
3. Read through 5 phrases before bed tonight
4. Tomorrow, try saying them out loud

That's it. Five phrases. Today.

Language learning doesn't have to be a marathon. It just has to start.

---

**One more thing:** I built Pocket Linguist to make this even easier. It's an app that helps you practice these exact phrases with AI conversation partners — real back-and-forth dialogue, no judgment, no pressure.

You don't need to download it today. But if you're curious: [Pocket Linguist on the App Store](#APP_STORE_LINK)

## Email 2 — Day 2

**Subject line:** The #1 mistake language learners make (and how to avoid it)

**Preview text:** Most people quit before they ever get good. Here's why — and what to do instead.

---

**Body:**

Hey {{first_name}},

I've talked to hundreds of language learners. And almost all of them make the same mistake.

They wait until they're "ready" before they try to speak.

They spend months with apps, textbooks, and YouTube videos — building vocabulary, studying grammar rules — but never actually using the language with another person.

Then when they finally try to speak, they freeze. It feels like they learned nothing.

Here's the truth: **fluency comes from producing the language, not just consuming it.**

Reading about Spanish won't make you speak Spanish. Listening to French podcasts won't either. You only get good at speaking by speaking — even badly, even with mistakes, even just to yourself.

**The fix is simpler than you think:**

- Start with 5 phrases (you already have them — your cheat sheet)
- Say them out loud. Today. Even if it's just in your bathroom mirror.
- Talk to someone, anyone, even an AI, who will respond in the language you're learning
- Do this for 10 minutes a day, 4 days a week

Consistency beats intensity every time.

The people who become fluent aren't necessarily the smartest. They're the ones who show up and practice speaking before they feel ready.

That's exactly why we built Pocket Linguist the way we did — but more on that in a couple of days.

---

Tomorrow: I'll share the fastest way to go from "I know some phrases" to holding an actual conversation.

Keep going,

## Email 3 — Day 4

**Subject line:** Meet Ang & Agnes — your personal language coaches

**Preview text:** Two AI conversation partners who never get impatient, never judge you, and are available at 2am.

---

**Body:**

Hey {{first_name}},

Quick question: have you ever tried speaking a new language with someone and completely frozen up — even though you knew the words?

That's called speaking anxiety, and it affects about 65% of language learners. It's why so many people "know" a language but can't seem to use it in real life.

The antidote is practice — but practice with low stakes. No embarrassment. No fear of judgment.

That's where **Ang and Agnes** come in.

**Ang** is a conversational AI partner built into Pocket Linguist. You pick a language, pick a scenario (ordering coffee, asking for directions, meeting someone new), and Ang responds naturally in that language. Miss a word? Ang helps. Get stuck? Ang nudges you forward. No judgment, no impatience.

**Agnes** is the teaching layer. After your conversation, Agnes reviews what went well, corrects pronunciation patterns, and gives you 3–5 things to focus on next time. Think of her as the language teacher you wish you had in school.

Together, they create a feedback loop:
**Speak → Get feedback → Improve → Speak again**

Most language apps give you passive exercises. Pocket Linguist gives you active conversation practice from day one.

---

**What users are saying:**

> "I practiced Japanese with Ang for 2 weeks before my Tokyo trip. When I actually got there, I wasn't even nervous — I'd already had the conversations dozens of times." — Maya J.

> "Agnes caught that I was mispronouncing 'merci' for literally 3 months. No human tutor ever noticed. Total game-changer." — Sam R.

## Email 4 — Day 7

**Subject line:** Your 7-Day Language Challenge starts now

**Preview text:** 7 days. 10 minutes a day. See what you can actually do.

---

**Body:**

Hey {{first_name}},

You've had the cheat sheet for a week. Let's put it to work.

I want to challenge you to a **7-Day Language Sprint.** It takes 10 minutes a day and it will genuinely surprise you how much you can learn in one week.

Here's the plan:

---

**Day 1 — Greetings**
Learn: Hello, goodbye, my name is, nice to meet you, how are you?
Practice: Say each phrase 5 times out loud.

**Day 2 — Numbers & survival phrases**
Learn: 1–10, yes, no, please, thank you, excuse me
Practice: Use them to "order" an imaginary coffee.

**Day 3 — Directions**
Learn: left, right, straight ahead, where is the ___?, hotel, airport, bathroom
Practice: Walk around your home and narrate directions in your target language.

**Day 4 — Food & restaurants**
Learn: I would like ___, the bill please, it's delicious, do you have ___?
Practice: Order your next meal out loud in your target language before you order it for real.

**Day 5 — Review day**
Go back through days 1–4. Which phrases stuck? Which ones didn't? Focus 5 minutes on your weak spots.

**Day 6 — Free conversation**
Try to hold a 2-minute conversation with an AI partner (Pocket Linguist is great for this). Just talk. It doesn't have to be perfect.

**Day 7 — Reflection**
Write down (or voice memo) 3 things you learned this week. Share it with someone. Celebrate.

---

Seven days from now, you'll have a working foundation in your target language. Not fluency — but a real, usable foundation. That's worth a lot.

Let me know how Day 1 goes? Just hit reply.

You've got this,

## Email 5 — Day 14

**Subject line:** Ready to level up, {{first_name}}?

**Preview text:** Two weeks in. Here's your next step.

---

**Body:**

Hey {{first_name}},

Two weeks ago you grabbed a free cheat sheet.

If you've been following along — practicing phrases, trying the 7-day challenge, speaking even a little — you're already ahead of most people who say they want to learn a language.

Seriously. Most people never start. You did.

Now here's the honest truth about where most self-learners get stuck at this stage:

**The gap between "I know some phrases" and "I can hold a real conversation" feels enormous.**

It's not. But it requires a bridge — consistent, low-stakes speaking practice with real feedback.

That's exactly what Pocket Linguist is built for.

**Here's what you get with the app:**

- AI conversation partners (Ang & Agnes) for 10+ languages
- Real dialogue scenarios: travel, business, casual conversation
- Instant pronunciation feedback — know immediately what to fix
- Daily 10-minute practice sessions that fit into any schedule
- Progress tracking so you can see how far you've come
- Offline mode — practice on a plane, in a subway, anywhere

**The free version gets you started.** Premium unlocks all languages, unlimited conversations, and Agnes's full feedback engine.

---

Thousands of language learners use Pocket Linguist to bridge exactly this gap. The ones who succeed share one trait: they kept showing up.

You've already shown up for two weeks.

Don't stop now.
